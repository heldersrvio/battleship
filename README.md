The Battleship game implemented using vanilla JavaScript. It's meant as a practice of Test Driven Development.

The player can choose between two modes (against the computer and against someone else). Then, they're prompted to place their ships on the board as they please by dragging them. Whoever is able to locate all of the enemies' ships first wins.
